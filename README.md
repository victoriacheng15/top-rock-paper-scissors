# Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Overview

This is a project based on **The Odin Project**'s curriculum. Please see [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) for more informaiton.

### About this Project

This project was to utilize my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build this game. This also followed the mobile first approach.

The player will pick one from rock or paper or sicssors. And the bot will randomly pick one as well. Each game has 5 round, so whoever reach score of 5, the winner will be determined.

### What I learned

- Set up functions for different purposes
- Follow the "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Select elements with dataset attributes
